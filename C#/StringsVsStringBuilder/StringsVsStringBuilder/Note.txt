C# - Strings Vs String Builder

Strings

String type is immutable. It means a string cannot be changed once created

When you modify a string it creates a copy.

String Builder

StringBuilder is mutable.

StringBuilder performs faster than string when appending multiple string values.

The StringBuilder doesn't create a new object in the memory but dynamically
expands memory to accommodate the modified string.
